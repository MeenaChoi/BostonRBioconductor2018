# BostonRBioconductor2018
BostonRBioconductor- 2018. 11. 20

## Abstract
Infrastructure isn't fun, isn't pretty, and isn't nearly respected as much as it should be. Bioconductor packages require a bit of added rigor compared to standard R packages, but the results are more stable, more extendable, and more trusted as a result. In this meetup, we will introduce how to build R packages, which can be pre-requisite for next meetup. We will discuss some issues with obtaining and documenting data in a reproducible way, briefly touch on creating generic object classes as well as an overview of some of the most popular Bioconductor classes and finally show how to create a simple Bioconductor ready package and how to create unit tests to improve reliability. It will cover the package structure and components, based on "R packages" (http://R-pkgs.had.co.nz) by Wickham and you will have your own R package at the end of this section.

## Target audience 
the biologists, chemists, bioinformaticians, data scientists, statisticians, engineers, who are comfortable with basic data structures in R, and have previously written their own R functions.

## Required software and package :
-	R : Download and install the latest version of R for your platform, https://cran.r-project.org
-	Rstudio : Download and install the lastest version of Rstudio desktop for your platform, https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download. Accept all defaults options during installation.
